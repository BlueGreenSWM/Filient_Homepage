# Rule System

Rules are the core of Filient, defining the logic that automatically organizes files.

Each rule is assigned to one folder and consists of conditions and actions.

## Rule Components

### Basic Structure
```
Rule = Condition(s) + Action(s) + Priority
```

- **Conditions**: Determine which files to apply to
- **Actions**: Tasks to perform on files that meet the conditions
- **Priority**: Execution order among multiple rules

## Creating Rules

### Creation Methods

**1. Manual Creation**
1. Select folder > Click "New Rule"
2. Enter rule information
3. Add conditions
4. Add actions
5. Save

**2. AI Assistant**
1. Select "New Rule"
2. Describe the desired behavior in natural language on the rule creation page
3. Review the rule generated by AI
4. Approve creation
5. Modify if needed and save the rule

**3. Use Template**
1. Select "Create from Template"
2. Choose from template library
3. Modify if needed and save the rule

## Conditions

This section sets the conditions for files on which actions will be executed.
Within a single condition, all elements operate with OR logic, and the condition is considered true if any one matches.
Multiple conditions operate with AND logic to each other, and actions are executed only when all conditions are true.

### Example

```

Condition 1: Extension = jpg, png, docx
Condition 2: Name contains the word "Screenshot"

```
In the above case, actions are performed on files with jpg **OR** png **OR** docx extensions that contain the word "Screenshot".

## Actions

This section sets actions for files, executing sequentially from the topmost action on files that match the conditions.

If an error occurs while sequentially executing actions a-b-c, the file is restored to its state before rule execution and moves to the next file.

## Rule Priority

### Setting Priority
Within the same priority level, rules at the top are executed first.
- **High**: Executed first
- **Medium**: Default priority
- **Low**: Executed last

When multiple rules apply to the same file, rules with higher priority are executed first.
