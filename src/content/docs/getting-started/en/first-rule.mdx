# Creating Your First Rule

This guide will walk you through creating your first automation rule in Filient step by step.
We'll create a simple rule that automatically moves PDF files from the Downloads folder to the Documents folder.

## üìÅ Before You Start: Adding a Folder

When you first launch Filient, it starts empty with no folders to manage. You need to add a folder first before creating rules.

### Why Add Folders?

Filient monitors only selected folders to optimize system performance. Instead of scanning the entire system, it efficiently manages files by selectively monitoring only the necessary folders.

### Step 1: Find the Add Folder Interface

When you open the Filient main screen, you'll see the following layout:

- **Left Sidebar**: Folder list and menu area
- **Folder Area**: Manage added folders

Find the **"Folder Management"** section at the top of the left sidebar.

### Step 2: Add a New Folder

#### Click the Add Folder Button
- Click the **‚ûï (plus)** button to the right of the Folder Management section header

#### macOS Folder Selection Dialog
- When you click the button, the standard macOS folder selection window will appear

#### Folder Selection Tips
- üéØ **Recommended Starting Folders**: Downloads, Desktop, Documents
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Folders to Avoid**: System, Library, Applications
- üí° **Smart Choice**: Start with your messiest folder

### Step 3: Confirm Folder Addition

After selecting a folder and clicking the **"Open"** button:

1. **Folder Appears in Sidebar**
   - Folder icon and name appear in the list
   - Expand arrow shown if there are subfolders

## üéØ Creating Your First Rule

Now that you've added a folder, let's create an automation rule.

### 1. Start Creating a Rule

#### Select a Folder
1. Click the folder you just added in the sidebar
2. When you select the folder, the rule list for that folder will appear on the right
3. Click the **"Create New Rule"** button in the upper right

![Rule Creation Button](/docs/images/rule-add-button.png)

#### Choose Rule Creation Method

When the rule creation dialog appears, you can choose one of two methods:

- üìã **Use Template**: Utilize pre-made templates
- üìù **Create Manually** + **AI Assistant**: Set conditions and actions directly (New Rule button)

For this example, we'll select **"Create New Rule"**.

![Rule Creation Method Selection](/docs/images/rule-creation-methods.png)

### 2. Enter Basic Information

When the rule creation screen appears, enter the basic information.

![Rule Basic Information](/docs/images/rule-info.png)

#### Rule Name
Give it a clear, easy-to-understand name:
```
Organize PDF Documents
```

#### Rule Description (Optional)
Add a description to easily identify the rule's purpose later:
```
Automatically move PDF files from Downloads folder to Documents folder
```

#### Rule Options
![Rule Basic Information](/docs/images/rule-options.png)
- ‚¨ú **Include Subfolders**: Apply rule to all subfolders within the folder
- ‚¨ú **Require Approval Before Execution**: Check if user approval is needed before execution
- ‚¨ú **Save Rule as Template**: Check whether to save the created rule as a template (one-time use)

### 3. Set Conditions

Conditions determine which files the rule applies to.

![Condition Setting Screen](/docs/images/condition.png)

#### Adding a Condition
1. Click the **"‚ûï Add Condition"** button
2. Select the condition type from the dropdown: **"File Extension"**
3. Enter the details: `Documents`
4. Click the **"OK"** button

![Condition Setting Screen](/docs/images/condition2.png)

#### Additional Condition Examples (Optional)
If you want more sophisticated filtering, you can add conditions:

**File Size Condition**:
- Condition Type: **"File Size"**
- Operator: **Greater than or equal to**
- Value: **100 KB**

This will only move PDF files that are 100KB or larger.

```
All conditions within a rule are connected by AND,
and elements within a single condition are grouped by OR.
```

### 4. Set Actions

Actions determine what to do with files that match the conditions.

![Action Setting Screen](/docs/images/action.png)

#### Adding an Action
1. Click the **"‚ûï Add Action"** button
2. Select the action type: **"Move File"**
3. Set the destination folder:
   - **Folder Path**: `~/Documents`
   - Or select directly with the **"Select Folder"** button
4. Click the **"OK"** button

![Action Setting Screen 2](/docs/images/action2.png)

#### Exception Handling
![Create Folder if Missing](/docs/images/move_option.png)

Click the gear button on the right side of the action to see detailed settings.

If the destination folder (~/Documents/PDF) doesn't exist:
- ‚úÖ **Auto-create**: Filient automatically creates the folder
- Hierarchical structures can also be automatically created (e.g., ~/Documents/2024/PDF)

If files conflict with the same name:
   - **Skip**: Don't move if a file with the same name exists
   - **Overwrite**: Replace the existing file with the new file
   - **Rename** (recommended): Save with a number appended (e.g., document(1).pdf)

### 5. Save and Test

#### Save the Rule
1. Double-check all settings
2. Click the **"Save"** button
3. The rule is added to the list and activated

#### Test Run (Recommended)

![Test Button](/docs/images/test_button.png)

You can preview results with a test before actual execution:

1. Select the three dots to the right of the saved rule to open the menu
2. Click the **"Test"** button
3. Review the simulation results:
   - Number of files that will be affected
   - Success/failure status, etc.
4. If satisfied with the results, execute through **"Run"** or schedule regular execution through scheduling
![Test Execution Results](/docs/images/test.png)

### 6. Execute and Review Results

#### Manual Execution
1. Select the rule and click the **"Run Now"** button
2. When execution is complete, you can review the execution summary
   - Success/failure/skipped counts

#### Execution History
All execution records are saved in history:
1. Click the **"History"** tab
2. Review the execution history
3. Click each record to see detailed information
4. Use the **"Rollback"** function to undo operations if needed

## üéâ Congratulations!

You've successfully created your first automation rule! Now when PDF files are added to the Downloads folder, they will automatically be moved to the Documents/PDF folder.

### Next Steps

Now that you've mastered the basics, try more advanced features:

#### üìö Create More Complex Rules
- Chain multiple actions (move ‚Üí rename ‚Üí tag)
- Combine multiple conditions

#### ‚è∞ Set Up Automation
- **Scheduler**: Automatically run every day at 9 AM
- **Batch Processing**: Execute multiple rules sequentially

#### üé® Create Templates
Save frequently used rules as templates:
1. Select rule ‚Üí **"Save as Template"**
2. Enter template name and description
3. Reusable in other folders

### Useful Rule Examples

#### üì∏ Screenshot Organization
